## üéØ Project: JavaScript Calculator

UPDATE: This assignment is due Thursday, Feb 1 at 9am. üå∫

NOTE: Your calculator does not have to look like the green one. It needs the same buttons, but you can add your own style.
Steps 1 & 2 are HTML and CSS, so start there. Then, move on to adding the event listener to one button, then all the numbers, and so on.

- [MDN Element Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element#events) -> this is where you can see the events that are defined for elements (like "click" or "mouseover")
- [MDN Event Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) -> this is a huge list of all the available events, useful mainly to get an idea of what's possible

### ‚≠êÔ∏è EXTRA/TMI

This resource is really not at all necessary to understand or do the project, _but_ if you want to know more about the concept of tree structures in computer science, check out this piece from [Vaidehi Joshi's BaseCS blog series](https://medium.com/basecs). She is awesome! There is also a thoroughly delightful accompanying [BaseCS podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs) with the equally amazing Saron Yitbarek.

And here is more info about what is happening when a browser renders a page -- very enlightening, although not strictly necessary at this stage:

- [About the browser rendering engine](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/#The_rendering_engine)
- [How browser rendering works](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-browser-rendering-works-behind-the-scenes-6782b0e8fb10/)

This is a good explanation about how JS events "bubble" up the chain of elements on the page:

If you would like to know more about the JavaScript Event Loop and how it works, I highly recommend this resource. Don't miss the video of the conference talk that goes along with it -- it's excellent:
