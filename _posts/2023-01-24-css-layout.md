OPTIONAL:
In this class, we will focus on flexbox. A popular alternative to flexbox for layout is called "grid", also built into CSS. With flexbox you choose to line up your boxes either vertically or horizontally, but with grid you can specify both horizontal and vertical arrangement in the same box.
