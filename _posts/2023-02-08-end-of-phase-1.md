- Practice with Exercism

## 🎙️ End of Phase Presentation

- No class on Thursday morning, so you can work on your presentations.
- Presentation during regular afternoon session time, 2pm, in classroom Zoom.
- You might not pass the phase if:.

- Your project does not meet the minimum requirements.
- Your project does not run without errors.
- You cannot explain how your code works.
- You do not turn in a video.

Each of you will present on either myTunes, Customer Database, or Calculator. The video should be 4-5 minutes long, and no longer. You should choose a piece of the code to walk through and explain using the concepts we covered during Phase 1. You might choose:

- Code that was challenging to figure out
- Code that you were excited about

Your target audience is a brand new Momentum student who is just at the beginning of Phase 1. Imagine you are teaching them how to do what you’ve done in this project. Give them the benefit of your experience over these past several weeks.

This video does not have to be polished, scripted, or edited. But your viewer should be able to follow what you’re saying and understand the points you are making.

### ⭐️ EXTRA/TMI

There's an awesome article about _stacks_, which we encounter in a _stack trace_ in our debugging adventures, in Vaidehi Joshi's BaseCS blog series. It's not necessary to read this to understand debugging, but if you want some more information about terminology and what's really happening, it's great!
